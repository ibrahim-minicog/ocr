Subject INTEGRITY OF WELLS LOCATED ON TOWER ZK-189

Please find attached the minutes of the meeting held on 3/7/2000 by DD, ZKFD and PDD job
officers to discuss the results of the integrity investigation which was carried out by Rig Ensco
on wells ZL 192 and 231.

The meeting concluded that wells ZL 192 should be worked over to ensure it’s integrity. »
It is therefore planned to incorporate this wells in 1* August 2000 bar chart to follow the work
over of wells on the same tower.

As for ZL 231, it was concluded that the x mas tree valves should be repaired which can be
carmied out without workover. The leak in the subsurface safety valve control line is tolerated as
far as the control line is isolated from the tubing by the A3 valve/Separation Sleeve and with the
current tubing pressure. However, a workover becomes a must when the tubing pressure starts to
increase with the possible exposure of the annulus to high tubing pressure through the leaking
control line.
