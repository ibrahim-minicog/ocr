The meeting discussed the current mechanical status of wells ZL 192 and 231 located on Tower
ZK 189 following the integrity investigation carried out by rig Ensco.

The following is recommended to ensure the integrity of the wells which are located in Th

IVC GIP area:

W 192 ng String IVB rt String IV,

The well has 14 A type completion (1981), with leaking X mas tree valves on both long and

short string sides.

It was not possible to pressure test the short string due to bad profile of the 2.75” F nipple.
Pressure was bled in the annulus to 0 psig and it produced gas. The pressure reached

270 psig in 3 hrs. and stabilized at 580 psig after 3 days. This pressure is close to the short
string pressure. It is recommended to workover the well to replace the completion and X mas

Tree due to the leaking RDH packer.
Well ZL 231(Long String [VB, Short String IVA)

The well has 1 CM type completion (1985), The tubing of both strings and the x mas tree
valves were tested to the required pressure. However, their was a need to fill up the annulus
