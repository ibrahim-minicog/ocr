15 % HCl acid = 1600 gals
65% Quality foamed gel = 600 gals
Base gel = 210 gals
Nitrogen = 149 gals

5. Overflush twice acid volume with diesel .

6. If injection rate is less than 2 BPM , then matrix acidize using
coiled tubing by spraying the perforations only with acid .i.e.
without diverting agent.
