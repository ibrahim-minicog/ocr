RIG Ensco-96
WELL NO. ZL-192

PETROLEUM ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS :

e Kill the well.

e Recover the existing completion.

e Check casing integrity

e Add the following perforation 9274’ — 9292’ (18’) Th. [V-BU using 4”
Casing gun, 4 SPF & 90 degree phasing (Ref. Logs: CNL/FDC dated 05-
05-1981 & CBL/VDL/GR/CCL dated 08-03-1981).

e Check / Ensure isolation between Tham. IV A & B sub-zones.

If a communication is confirmed, a remedial squeeze job is needed to

ensure the isolation.

Run 16 AM completion.*

Test the string to 4500 psig.

Matrix acidize Tham. IV perforations as per the attached stimulation sheets.

Clean-up the well & re-check isolation by Amerada gauges.

Secure the well.

     
     
   
   
   
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      
      
     
      
 

* As recommended by ZKFD, (Memo # 22 / 28100 dated 3rd July, 2000) Otis
FXE down hole safety valve (Rated 10,000 psi) should be used in this well.

* The safety valve control line should be rated to 10,000 psig.

* The control line and X-mas tree cavity to be tested to 6500 psig.

* To run 2.75” Otis nipples in both strings which will facilitate testing the

tubing to 4500

Note: Pending a safety review, risk analysis and securing the required hydraulic
pressure to the control line, the testing of the control line and X-mas tree
cavity to 6500 psig to be investigated by DD and to be discussed and

Implemented if considered safe.
