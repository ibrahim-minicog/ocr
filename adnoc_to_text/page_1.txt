PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT DIVISION
WORKOVER WELL DATA SHEET

RIG Ensco-96
WELL NO. ZL-192
WELL HISTORY :

The well was drilled and completed by rig Trident III in March 1981 as a dual
segregated producer from Tham. [VA / IVBL through type 14 A completion.
Top of 7” liner & 9 5/8” DV tool were dry tested.
Isolation was proved then confirmed during clean-up operations.
On June 2000 rig Ensco-96 was moved on the tower to check integrity of
well- head equipment and down-hole tubulars. The test had the following
conclusion:
. Leaking of X mas tree valves on both sides.
. Unable to pressure the short string due to bad profile of the 2.75” F-nipple.
. Observed continuous build up of pressure in the annulus from 0 psi to 210
psi in two hours. Bled the annulus, produced gas. Pressure built from 0 psi
to 270 psi in three hours. It reached a maximum of 580 psi after 3 days.
This pressure is close to the short string pressure.
Consequently it is recommended to workover the well to replace the
completion and X- mas tree, add perforation and complete the well as a
dual producer through type 16 AM completion.
