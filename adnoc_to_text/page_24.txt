with 60 Bbls of inhibited sea water prior to achieve a test to 2000 psig. Upon bleeding the test
pressure, about 3 bbls of oil were received at the burner. The well does not have a history of
annulus pressure (maximum 50 psig before rig move). It was reported that the annulus pressure

stabilized at 40 Psig (Forty) after 4 days.

The control line of the long string is leaking and hence an A3 subsurface safety valve is
currently in use along with a separation sleeve which isolates the control line from the tubing .

The short string x mas tree valves are leaking.

Recommendation: There is no need for immediate Workover as the X mas tree

valves can be repaired without a workover . The current status of the control line is

acceptable provided that the tubing pressure remains at or bellow the current level. However if
the long string pressure increases which is a sign of gas breakthrough, the A3 valve should
always remain in place isolati:. 2 the Control line from tubing. Wire line runs are not
allowed under such conditions. Therefore, the Workover becomes a must if an increase in
tubing pressure is observed.

Zakum Field Division is requested to take note of the above.

Attachment: Table with detailed results of investigation carried out on the wells.
